# iDryerMod

[Русская версия](README.RU.md)

Firmware for a two-spool filament dryer based on the ESP32-WROOM-32D.
The design goal: **keep plastic dry** — a preset does not just hold a
temperature for a fixed time, it dries the spool until it is actually dry,
then keeps it at storage temperature and automatically re-dries when moisture
comes back (lid opened, fresh spool dropped in).

Current firmware version: **0.2.1**

## Key features

- **Dry-to-completion presets** — each preset defines a minimum active-drying
  time, a safety ceiling, a storage (hold) temperature and a dryness
  threshold. Drying runs until the spool stops releasing moisture, then the
  chamber settles into a low-power Hold phase and watches for re-wetting.
- **Dryness estimation from the chamber air** — with the vent sealed, the
  absolute-humidity (AH) rise is the moisture released by the filament. A
  least-squares slope over a sealed measurement window (g/m³ per hour) is the
  dryness signal; weight sensors are not required for it.
- **Temperature cascade** — the air-temperature PID outputs a *heater (NTC)
  setpoint* bounded by `[air target .. heater limit − 5 °C]`; an inner
  thermostat (±1 °C hysteresis) switches the MOSFET fully on/off. The heater
  is never driven hotter than the chamber actually needs.
- **Pulse ventilation** — `Sealed → Purge → Settle` cycle: the vent stays
  closed while moisture accumulates (and is measured); a short purge
  exchanges the air once AH rises ≥ 0.5 g/m³ above the window baseline or
  hits the saturation guard. The fan runs at a quiet circulation duty while
  sealed and at boost duty only during purges.
- **Safety first** — a fan interlock at the actuator layer guarantees airflow
  whenever the heater may be powered (`heating ⇒ fan ≥ floor`, applied
  fan-first), on top of the NTC limit gates and the hardware thermal fuse.
- **Two HX711 load cells** — per-spool weight telemetry with tare/scale
  calibration and a 16-band (5 °C) thermal-drift compensation table.
- **Web panel + REST API** over Wi-Fi with mDNS (`dryer.local`), telemetry
  history in LittleFS, optional HTTP Basic authentication.
- **OTA updates over Wi-Fi** — both ArduinoOTA and a web endpoint; no USB
  cable needed after the first flash.
- **Local UI** — SH1106 OLED + rotary encoder menu.
- **19 native unit tests** for the control logic, runnable on the host.

## Hardware

| Function | GPIO | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| I²C SDA / SCL | 21 / 22 | AHT30 + display, 400 kHz |
| Encoder A / B / button | 32 / 33 / 25 | |
| Heater MOSFET | 26 | 24 V PTC via logic-level N-MOSFET |
| Fans MOSFET | 27 | two 24 V fans in parallel, 20 kHz PWM |
| Vent servo | 14 | powered from a separate 5–6 V rail |
| NTC (heater slot) | 34 | ADC1, 10 kΩ / B=3950 divider |
| HX711 #1 DOUT/SCK | 16 / 17 | |
| HX711 #2 DOUT/SCK | 18 / 19 | |

Sensors: AHT30 (chamber air T/RH), NTC in the PTC slot (heater temperature),
2 × HX711 with 4-wire load cells. A 120 °C thermal fuse in series with the
heater remains an independent hardware layer that software does not replace.

Power design notes, NTC divider math and layout recommendations live in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Control architecture

```
air target ──► [air PID] ──► heater (NTC) setpoint ──► [thermostat ±1°C] ──► MOSFET on/off
                   ▲                 bounded by [target .. limit−5°C]
                   │
              AHT30 air T

AH target ──► [PurgeScheduler]  Sealed ──► Purge ──► Settle ──► Sealed ...
                   │                ▲         │
                   │                │         └─ purge: vent open, fan boost
                   │                └─ trigger: AH rise ≥ 0.5 g/m³ or saturation
                   │
             [AhSlopeEstimator]  slope of AH over the sealed window
                   │
             dryness: slope < threshold for 2 consecutive windows
```

- **Fan policy**: circulation duty while sealed (heater airflow + mixing),
  boost during purge/settle; always at least the configured floor when the
  heater is on. The fan never runs wide open just because it can.
- **Hold phase**: after drying, the chamber holds the preset storage
  temperature and keeps measuring. If moisture returns
  (`drynessChecks` reset), the machine automatically re-enters Drying with a
  fresh time budget.
- **Manual mode** stays a plain countdown; **continuous mode** holds
  conditions until stopped.

Dryness thresholds (0.3 g/m³/h) and window timings are **empirical first
guesses** — they are exposed in telemetry (`dryness.*` in `/api/state`) and
should be recalibrated from logs on real spools.

## Building and flashing

```powershell
# full build
pio run -e esp32dev

# flash over USB (first time)
pio run -e esp32dev -t upload
pio run -e esp32dev -t uploadfs        # web panel assets (LittleFS)

# flash over Wi-Fi afterwards (ArduinoOTA)
pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload
# or with a raw IP if mDNS is blocked:
pio run -e esp32dev_ota -t upload --upload-port 192.168.1.238
```

During an OTA transfer the firmware temporarily unsubscribes the main task
from the watchdog (ArduinoOTA receives the image inside a blocking
`handle()` call) and pauses LittleFS telemetry writes.

## First start

1. With no saved Wi-Fi credentials the device opens the
   `FilamentDryer-Setup` access point — connect and configure your network
   through the web panel. If the station cannot join for 60 s, the setup AP
   comes back automatically.
2. On the home network the panel is reachable at `http://dryer.local`
   (mDNS; the IP is also shown on the display).
3. Authentication is optional: an empty web password disables it. When set,
   the login defaults to `admin` (configurable) and the same password also
   protects ArduinoOTA. Set a password before powering the heater side.

Before connecting power stages, verify that GPIO26 stays low at boot, on
reset, on NTC faults and during OTA.

## REST API (short)

```
GET  /api/state        full status incl. dryness.* telemetry and firmware version
GET  /api/config       settings + preset list
PUT  /api/config       change settings (Wi-Fi, auth, fan floor, scales...)
POST /api/run          start a run {mode, preset | temperatureC, durationSeconds...}
POST /api/stop         stop
POST /api/pause        pause / resume toggle
GET  /api/history      telemetry (JSONL window)
GET  /api/events       event log
GET  /api/calibration  weight-calibration status
POST /api/calibration  tare / known-mass / drift-run operations
POST /api/ota          firmware upload (multipart)
```

## Remote debugging

`tools/remote.ps1` polls the panel over Wi-Fi — no USB cable attached:

```powershell
powershell -File tools\remote.ps1 status              # one full snapshot
powershell -File tools\remote.ps1 watch 3600          # live telemetry -> telemetry-*.jsonl
powershell -File tools\remote.ps1 history out.json    # download telemetry
powershell -File tools\remote.ps1 events out.json     # download event log
powershell -File tools\remote.ps1 ota                 # flash .pio\build\esp32dev_ota\firmware.bin
```

Add `-HostName 192.168.x.x` when mDNS is blocked on your network.

## Tests

Native unit tests cover the actuator interlock, thermostat band, cascade
bounds, purge cycle, AH slope regression, dry→hold transitions and the
manual-mode countdown:

```powershell
pio test -e native
```
